23-1 Database Class Proejct

## Phase 1

In phase 1, we received 36,531 records made up of 42 columns and had to model this raw data into formatted data.

**Result**: queries for creating Views and ER-Diagram.

## Phase 2

For modeled data from phase 1, we had to make queries for certain purpose and optimze them.

Our team optimzed queries by 
1. Examining each implemented queries whether it contains unnecessary calculation and remove them
2. Adopting index for proper tables.

**Result**: Optimized queries satisfying their purpose, achieving average speed (ms) as 10% decreased.
